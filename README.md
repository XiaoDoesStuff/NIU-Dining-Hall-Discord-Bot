# NIU-Dining-Hall-Discord-Bot
A configurable Docker-based service that sends Discord notifications when NIU dining halls offer a specified food item.

## This Discord bot had AI involved in creation:
- AI created the Docker container itself
- AI created the index.js this bot is based off. 
  - This Bot is based on a discord bot AI made to only check for shrimp.
  - The functions and menus are now configurable.
